## How to Connect to Cluster

This manual describes how to launch a node and connect it to the clusters.

### Staging Cluster

**IMPORTANT**: It's assumed that you already built a node in **testnet staging** mode. To do it use this script:

```
$ ./scripts/build/cardano-sl.sh --tns
```

Now run this script:

```
$ ./scripts/launch/connect-to-cluster/staging.sh
```

One single node will be launched.
